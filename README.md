# Plover-Dictionaries
Some of my personal dictionaries for Plover.

**thumb_numbers.json**  changes the stroke for reversing digits to \*E instead of \*EU to make it easier to use with the TinyMod, which uses a thumb key in the middle as it's number key.

**TinyMod_layout.json**  is a custom layout to be used with Plover's layout display plugin, when using a TinyMod.

Both files should be useful for the Gherkin as well.
