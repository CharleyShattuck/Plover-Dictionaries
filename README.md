# Plover-Dictionaries
Some of my personal dictionaries for Plover.

**symbols.json**  pairs of strokes for symbols. -FPLT for left side and -RBGS for the right side spacing. Allows space before and space after but no spaces inside. Like (this) for example. I don't use this one anymore. I prefer Emily's symbol dictionary.   <https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols>

**thumb_numbers.json**  changes the stroke for reversing digits to \*E instead of \*EU to make it easier to use with the TinyMod, which uses a thumb key in the middle as it's number key.

**TinyMod_layout.json**  is a custom layout to be used with Plover's layout display plugin, when using a TinyMod.

**directions.json**  movement keys broken out of my personal dictionary.

Both files should be useful for the Gherkin as well.
